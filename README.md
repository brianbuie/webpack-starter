## Quick Start

In the terminal (with yarn installed globally):

`git clone git@github.com:brianbuie/webpack-starter.git "New Project" && cd "New Project" && yarn install && yarn new-project`

This will clone the repo, install dependencies, and remove the git repo

For quick future projects, I've added this alias to my ~/.bash_profile

`alias new-webpack-project='git clone git@github.com:brianbuie/webpack-starter.git "New Project" && cd "New Project" && yarn install && yarn new-project'`

then I just type `new-webpack-project` in the terminal and BAM!

## Why?

Whenever I have a quick idea or want to screw around with something, I hate NOT using webpack, but I also hate setting up webpack fresh.

I also don't like using starter-packs that are already full of stuff. This is intended to make it easy to init and start adding the packages I need for the project.
